         <p>One major revolution in architecture is presented each year, and yet the four walls, floor and ceiling of the box are inevitable

         Can a body of work be built on the basis of one good idea? If so, what makes such an idea? Is the measure of a good idea how much it renders further ideas unnecessary? When something good is invented, what reason can there be against applying it until something better comes along? Once the ideal paradigm is established, we repeat it. Everything unfolds from there; further choices are self-evident.</p></br>

         There are many ideas; there are few good ideas. Good ideas occur infrequently. Technology, the media and the internet do nothing to change that. Sometimes centuries pass before the next good idea presents itself. Entire generations are forgotten by history because they didnâ€™t have a good idea.</p></div>
