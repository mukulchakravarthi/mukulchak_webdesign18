         <p>The proper mathematical definition of the box is a ‘rectangular prism’: a six-faced volume with each face set at 90-degree angles to the adjoining ones. Still, when it is referred to as ‘a box’, an important semantic shift occurs. Where the rectangular prism denotes volume and mass as a single entity, the box separates these. The rectangular prism is a finite entity; the box is by definition incomplete: a container, something empty and in need of filling. The box exists only by virtue of what it contains – in a state of anticipation, waiting for content, whatever that may turn out to be. In architectural terms, the box is not a matter of form following function but of form preceding function – a way to capture the largest possible multiplicity of uses.</br></br>

        Block, slab, tower, hall: architecture has multiple names for the box. But since they all describe the same form, their effect on form is limited. No matter what height, length or width it is, a box is still a box. Neither a focus on a proportional system nor an insistence on typological purity fundamentally changes the box. In obeying the laws of both art and science, the box is ultimately neither.</p>
