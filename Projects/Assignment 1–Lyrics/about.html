					<p>Hello? Hello? Hello?<br/>
					Is there anybody in there?<br/>
					Just nod if you can hear me<br/>
					Is there anyone at home?<br/>
					Come on now<br/>
					I hear you're feeling down<br/>
					Well I can ease your pain<br/>
					Get you on your feet again<br/>
					Relax<br/></br>
					I'll need some information first<br/>
					Just the basic facts<br/>
					Can you show me where it hurts?<br/>
					There is no pain you are receding<br/>
					A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br/>
					You are only coming through in waves<br/>
					Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br/>
					When I was a child I had a fever<br/>
					My hands felt just like two balloons<br/>
					Now I've got that feeling once again<br/>
					I can't explain you would not understand<br/>
					This is not how I am<br/>
					I have become comfortably numb<br/>
					Okay<br/></br>
					Just a little pinprick<br/>
					There'll be no more, ah<br/>
					But you may feel a little sick<br/>
					Can you stand up?<br/>
					I do believe it's working, good<br/>
					That'll keep you going through the show<br/>
					Come on it's time to go<br/>
					There is no pain you are receding<br/>
					A distant ship, smoke on the horizon<br/>
					You are only coming through in waves<br/>
					Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br/>
					When I was a child<br/>
					I caught a fleeting glimpse<br/>
					Out of the corner of my eye<br/>
					I turned to look but it was gone<br/>
					I cannot put my finger on it now<br/>
					The child is grown<br/>
					The dream is gone<br/>
					I have become comfortably numb</p>
